VAEs - A pretty good intro - https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/variational-autoencoder

Multiple Loss function training optimization - https://medium.com/@baicenxiao/strategies-for-balancing-multiple-loss-functions-in-deep-learning-e1a641e0bcc0. Good tricks on balancing different loss functions - esp with different scales of magnitudes (direct addition would probably lead to ignorance of the smaller one) - useful in GAN based architectures to stabilize training
